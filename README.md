Welcome to CoPs (Club of Programmers) where all the ICT Students Join Forces to improve our skills and knowledge in programming!

# ⚡ Fun fact
The Logo of our club is based upon a modern yet traditional theme of Programming! The middle of the logo is the tag symbol for the reason that it visualizes how most of the time we use the symbol or variable to make our code function.
